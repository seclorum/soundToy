### soundtoy - a simple toy for exploring the Oric-1/Atmos synthesizer capabilities

The Oric-1/Atmos computers (released: 1983) were a wonderful 8-bit series of computers
which included some nice synthesizer capabilitiies in the form of the 8192 sound chip.

soundtoy gives you a way of experimenting with the synthesizer of your Oric-1/Atmos.

V0.0.1	- Basic first version - use to explore the Oric ROM data to use as
		  seeds to the 8192 synthesizer registers.  Use 'j' and 'k' keys to step
		  through ROM addresses to listen to the various 'presets' available in
		  your Oric - use the '?' key to get help and some example addresses to
		  try out.

V0.0.2	- Added HIRES video synth mode.  TODO: connect both synthesizers in pleasing, absttract ways.

V0.0.3  - Exploring the RANDOM nature of things.  The colour-bar that is generated in
HIRES ("G") mode of soundtoy, represents a playground of colourful 'sprites' which have been pre-filtered to ensure no attribute colour-clash occurs when they are placed adjacent to each other .. At this stage, I am exploring/hacking around, and things don't quite work properly yet, but the controls are there to drive into interesting territory.


Lets hear of your discoveries!  :)
