### soundtoy - a simple toy for exploring the Oric-1/Atmos synthesizer capabilities

The Oric-1/Atmos computers (released: 1983) were a wonderful 8-bit series of computers
which included some nice synthesizer capabilitiies in the form of the 8192 sound chip.

soundtoy gives you a way of experimenting with the synthesizer of your Oric-1/Atmos.

V1.0.0	- Basic first version - use to explore the Oric ROM data to use as
		  seeds to the 8192 synthesizer registers.  Use 'j' and 'k' keys to step
		  through ROM addresses to listen to the various 'presets' available in
		  your Oric - use the '?' key to get help and some example addresses to
		  try out.

Lets hear of your discoveries!  :)
